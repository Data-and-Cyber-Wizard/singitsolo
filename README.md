It allows users to select songs, join a queue, and interact with fellow singers and the audience. 

The application brings a unique twist to traditional karaoke by incorporating a voting system and a rewards mechanism, allowing users to earn points based on audience votes. These points can then be redeemed for various rewards within the venue, such as a free drink, side dish, or meal.
